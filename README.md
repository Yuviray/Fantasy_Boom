# FANTASY BOOM

This a Machine Learning project that will be used to predict which NFL players are most likely to beat their fantasy projections by a large amount such as 5 points.

Using Historical data from the last 5 years and current in-season data, The Machine learning model will use the input features given to it that have been shown to correlate with fantasy perfomance using visualization tools. The model will then determine if the player os likey to "Boom" past their fantasy prediction for that week.


## General Setup
The data is sourced from various API resources where it will get cleaned and loaded into a SQL database with different tables for each variation of data that needs to be worked.

This data is then modeled in Power BI to see which data points have the greatest affect on fantasy points scoring.

The input features that are chosen are then using for training with the previous week actual fantasy points scored per player being used as the label. 

## Why was this made
This is a passion project, as I am in 3 different fantasy leagues and want another way to get an advantage over league mates. I also wanted a project taht combined SQL, Power Bi and Machine Learning so that I learn more about all three.

# Future Plans
This project will continually be updated throughout the 2026 inoder for the model to grow and improve as training on it changed throughout the season. The plan is to eventually make this into a website where is can be accesed by anyone.
